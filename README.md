# Embedded Systems Portfolio

Welcome to my embedded systems portfolio!  
Here you will find a collection of my projects involving microcontrollers, firmware development, electronics, PCB design, automation, and robotics.  
This repository showcases my practical experience with real-world embedded solutions.

## About Me
I am an Electronics and Embedded Systems Engineer with hands-on experience in:
- Microcontroller programming (STM32, ESP32, Arduino, NXP)
- Embedded firmware development in C/C++ and Python and Lua
- Hardware integration, testing, and debugging
- PCB design for digital and analog systems
- Robotics and automation projects
- Real-time applications using sensors, actuators, and communication protocols

I enjoy designing complete systems—from circuit design and PCB layout to firmware implementation and final testing.
